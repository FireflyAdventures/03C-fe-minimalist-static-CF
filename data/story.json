  "NarrativeStep": "In a faraway castle in the land of Mistral in the Kingdom of Provence there once lived a little girl named Helen and her giant Flemish Rabbit named Heather. The people far and wide were blessed with good fortune and bounteous harvests. The court astrologer Joseph once surveyed the harvests, and stars, and calendar, and discovered an amazing fact. After a visit by the Helen and Heather, to any farm, creamery, windmill, or fishing village, in short, a visit to anywhere associated with  the growing and harvesting of nature’s bounty, that place would flourish in the coming year. In fact, Helen spent most of  her time trotting her mother’s elderly pony and buggy to and fro to visit these sites. She even helped in moving important tools, the mail, and inventions to these places, but she always left enough space for Heather to come along. Before long the fame of Helen, Heather, and Oats (the pony) spread beyond Provence and visitors came with offers to purchase Heather’s kits. Physically, Helen, despite being a princess was a strong girl, much of this had to do with her upbringing. Helen’s chores, which were not princess like in the least, included chopping firewood in Fall, milking two goats in the morning for breakfast, and using the tread pump filling the castle water tank daily (this involved pumping 300 liters up 3 meters) so that the kitchen and bathrooms had pressure. Also, Mistral was a hotbed of invention, as Joseph and Papa, the lord of Mistral, were always looking for ways to improve life, sometimes Helen would be directed to help on the newest idea.",

  "QuestionPrompt": ["The first indication of trouble came almost immediately when the stable master John shouted that Spinnaker (the fastest horse in the castle) and a saddle were missing. However, Gallagher’s cart was present, but there was no sign of him. A chill went through Helen’s heart that Heather may have been stolen.", "Papa quickly said “go to your studies” we have enough hands and effort on this task. Helen felt a surge of anger at being sent to do something as unimportant as studies, especially given all the math that Stephen constantly spouted, and tested" ],

    "TALE SO FAR:   After Stephen the tutor had released Helen from her studies, she thought to herself “how can I capture that rascal Gallagher and get back Heather”? Just then Adam the squire turned the corner of the stone hallway and said “are you done with math yet? The actual merchant just arrived, that Rogue shot him and stole the cart then sold all the supplies to us”. Papa is planning on letting the merchant recover here at the Castle but is sending me in the buggy with another horse after Gallagher. The Merchant’s name is Robert’, and he said he heard a horse coming down the path at a gallop, when he saw a cloaked rider, which may have been Gallagher riding towards the NorthWest with a sack. I am getting ready to go, just picking up my bow and a cloak for the ride”. Helen realized she was in another decision point. Pretend that Papa had let her go and ride along with the squire? or ask Papa’s permission to go but maybe not be allowed? What to do, what to do? She’d never embarked on a trip before so late in the season and knows travel in Winter is treacherous at least and deadly at wors",
